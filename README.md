# Question Answering COVID-19 Research Dataset


• This project aims to build a Question Answering System to automatically answer a correct answer for a Query asked by the user regarding COVID-19 using research documents.It presents only the requested information instead of searching full documents like search engine. 

• The Question Answering System ranks documents based on the search keywords in the query, based on cosine similarity scores applied on TF-IDF vectors for documents.

• Once the relevant documents are retrieved based on the query, the answers are summarized specific for a query.

• The Question Answering System developed produced good results for diverse queries related to COVID-19.
